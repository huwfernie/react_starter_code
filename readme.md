Starter code for a react App

based on the online tutorial at https://scotch.io/tutorials/setup-a-react-environment-using-webpack-and-babel

The files are managed with yarn, so if you download you should be able to run "yarn install"

then from the root folder "yarn start"

that should run the webpack-dev-server on http://localhost:8080/
